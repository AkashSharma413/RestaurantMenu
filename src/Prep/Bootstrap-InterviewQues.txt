Q10 : What do you understand by column ordering in Bootstrap?

       You might alternatively put them in a different column. Use the push and pull column classes to easily rearrange or rearrange the order of the columns. These
       classes are used in conjunction with the .col-xs-#, .col-sm-#, .col-md-#, and .col-lg-# Bootstrap grid classes.

      .col-xs-push-# and .col-xs-pull-# are the push and pull classes for the Bootstrap grid. This also works well for sm, md, and lg. The pull class moves columns to
       the left, whereas the push class moves them to the right.


Q11 : Explain the affix plugin.

ANS : The affix plugin allows you to affix a <div> to a particular location on the page. You may also use this plugin to turn on and off the pinning. Social icons are

       with the rest of the page.


Q12 : In Bootstrap, what is a scrollspy?

Q13 : How is tooltip different from popover?

ANS : - When the user moves the mouse pointer over an element, the Tooltip component appears as a little pop-up box. The Popover component is a pop-up box that emerges

      - Align Item with class .align-item-stretch, .align-item-start, .align-item-end, .align-item-baseline, .align-item-center
